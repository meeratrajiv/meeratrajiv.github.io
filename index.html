        <p>When I was almost 3 years old, I broke my leg(literally). I was running, and then I tripped. I went to the docter's office,to the urgent care section, and got some leg braces. It was very painful. After that, the docter was outside and I made a cylinder. The docter called me smart (remember, I was 2 YEARS OLD!!) and it cheered up my parents. Then, the docter let me choose a cast. I chose blue, because that was my favorite color at the time. While I had the cast on, I tried to move as much as possible. I read about the earth's crust, and talked(a lot).</p><br>
